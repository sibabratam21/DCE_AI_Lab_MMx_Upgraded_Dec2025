    <h1>Test Recalibration</h1>
    <p>Open the browser console and navigate to the app at http://localhost:5174</p>
    <p>Then follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the Modeling tab</li>
        <li>Click "Recalibrate"</li>
        <li>Select only 2 channels in the wizard</li>
        <li>Complete the wizard and click "Start Training"</li>
        <li>Watch the console for these debug messages:</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common Issues to Check:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If models are generated but filtered out: Check for "Model X filtered out due to channel mismatch" messages</li>
        <li>If no models generated: Check "[TrainingAPI] Generated models: { count: 0 }"</li>
        <li>If models not reaching leaderboard: Check "[App.tsx] onModelsUpdated callback received"</li>
    </ul>
